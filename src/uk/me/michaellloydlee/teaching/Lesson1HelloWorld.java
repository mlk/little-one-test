    // A method is some code that does something useful.
    // In Java we has a special method called main that we can run.
    // See the green arrow, click on it and select `Run Lesson1HelloWorld.main()'
    // Methods have four things to them that we currently care about.
    // public static <- Don't worry about these two for now, just know they are needed.
    // void          <- (1) A method can return something. void means 'nothing'.
    // main          <- (2) The name of the method. This is to make it easier to read and coming up with good names is one of the hardest parts of computing.
    // String[] args <- (3) A method can return information and take in information. This method takes in some information which we call 'args'.
    // { ... }       <- (4) Finally this is the code, at the moment this method does not do anything. We'll make it do something in a minute.
    // Now lets look at 'Console'.
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }

    // Notice that this method does not have a green arrow.
    // This is because it is not called 'main'
